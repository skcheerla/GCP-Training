Private Google Access in GCP
What it is:
Private Google Access in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) allows virtual machine (VM) instances and other resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network to access Google APIs and services using internal IP addresses, rather than requiring external (public) IP addresses.

Why it's important:

Security: By keeping traffic internal to Google's network, you reduce exposure to the public internet, which enhances security.
Cost-effectiveness: You avoid egress costs associated with traffic leaving your VPC and going over the internet to reach Google services.
Compliance: For certain regulatory or compliance requirements, keeping traffic private is often a necessity.
Simplified Networking: It simplifies firewall rules and network configurations as you don't need to open ports to the internet for accessing Google services.
How it works:
Private Google Access is enabled on a subnet-by-subnet basis within your VPC network. When enabled, VMs in that subnet (even those without external IP addresses) can reach Google APIs and services using special internal IP ranges provided by Google. The traffic routes privately within Google's backbone network.


Key characteristics:

Applies to VMs and other resources without external IP addresses.
Configured at the subnet level.
Routes traffic to Google APIs and services over internal, private pathways.
Different from "Private Service Access" or "Private Service Connect," which are for connecting to services published by other VPCs or managed services.
Similar Option in AWS
The similar option to Private Google Access in AWS is VPC Endpoints (specifically Interface Endpoints and Gateway Endpoints), often leveraged with AWS PrivateLink.
